In this folder, you can find information about the data used in this master's thesis. Three different datasets are used in this research:

  -> CIFAR-10
  -> Tiny Image Dataset
  -> Domain Net Dataset

## Outlier Dataset

[**80 Million Tiny Images is available here (mirror link).**](http://www.archive.org/download/80-million-tiny-images-2-of-2/tiny_images.bin)

If you do not want to use 80 Million Tiny Images, we prepared a cleaned ("debiased") subset with 300K images. We removed images that belong to CIFAR classes from it, images that belong to Places or LSUN classes, and images with divisive metadata.
